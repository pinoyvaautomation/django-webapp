# Render Website Downtime Recovery Guide

## üö® When Your Website is Down

If your Django website hosted on Render is not responding or showing errors, follow these steps to quickly restore service.

## üîß Quick Recovery Steps

### Step 1: Check Service Status
1. Go to your Render Dashboard
2. Navigate to the **Events** tab/page: [https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1e9kb95pdvs73bqqb80/events](https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d1e9kb95pdvs73bqqb80/events)
3. Check recent events for any deployment failures or service issues

### Step 2: Manual Deploy/Restart Service
1. From the Events page, click the **"Manual Deploy"** button
2. **Available Options**:
   - **"Restart service"** ‚≠ê **KEY OPTION** - Quickly restarts your service (fastest recovery)
   - **"Deploy latest commit"** - Redeploys with current code
   - **"Deploy a specific commit"** - Deploy a previous working version
   - **"Clear build cache & deploy"** - Fresh rebuild (if other options fail)

### Step 3: Monitor Recovery
1. Watch the deployment logs in real-time
2. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)
3. Test your website once deployment shows as "Live"

## üîß Manual Deploy Options Explained

| Option | When to Use | Speed | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Restart service** ‚≠ê | Service is stuck/frozen | Fastest (30-60s) | Simply restarts the running service |
| **Deploy latest commit** | After code changes | Medium (2-5 min) | Rebuilds and deploys current code |
| **Deploy a specific commit** | Need to rollback | Medium (2-5 min) | Deploy a previous working version |
| **Clear build cache & deploy** | Build issues persist | Slowest (5-10 min) | Complete fresh rebuild |

## üìä Common Downtime Scenarios

| Scenario | Best Solution |
|----------|---------------|
| Service sleeping (free tier) | **Restart service** |
| Service frozen/unresponsive | **Restart service** |
| Build failure | Check logs, fix issues, then **Deploy latest commit** |
| Memory/CPU limits exceeded | **Restart service**, consider upgrading plan |
| Database connection issues | **Restart service**, check DB status |
| Environment variable changes | **Deploy latest commit** to apply new settings |

## üîç Troubleshooting Checklist

Before manual deployment, check:
- [ ] Recent code changes that might have caused issues
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] No recent Render platform issues (check Render status page)
- [ ] Database service is running (if using external DB)
